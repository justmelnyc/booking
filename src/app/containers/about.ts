              thinkers, though, Medium is a network of thought. Connecting people together increases their
              knowledge and capabilities. Connecting ideas together increases their value, as well.</p>
            <p class="network__p">Medium is not for everybody, but it’s open to everybody. It encourages
              participation and a diversity of opinion. Anyone can earn influence on Medium via the value of
              their ideas, thoughtfulness of their responses, or quality of their rhetoric.”</p>
